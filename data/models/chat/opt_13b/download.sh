# Model: OPT-13B
# OPT was first introduced in "OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068) and first released in metaseq's repository on May 3rd 2022 by Meta AI. OPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like GPT-3.
